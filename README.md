# Hospital-Management-System-Java-Console-Application-
This Hospital Management System is a console-based application developed in Java, designed to streamline and organize basic hospital operations. The system focuses on managing doctor and patient interactions, enabling patients to book appointments with doctors while ensuring seamless scheduling and availability tracking. 
Features:

    Doctor Management:
        Doctors are registered in the system with unique details, including their name and specialization.
        The system tracks doctor availability based on patient bookings.

    Patient Management:
        Patients can register their information and access the system to book doctor appointments.
        Each patient can choose a doctor and specify a preferred appointment date.

    Appointment Scheduling:
        The system checks the availability of a doctor for the selected date.
        If the doctor is already booked on that day, the system notifies the patient with a message: “Doctor unavailable.”
        If the doctor is available, the system confirms the appointment and updates the schedule.

    Conflict Management:
        Real-time checks prevent double-booking of doctors.
        Patients can reselect dates or choose another doctor if conflicts arise.

This Hospital Management System emphasizes functionality and ease of use in a console-based environment, making it ideal for beginners learning Java or institutions looking for a simple hospital scheduling solution. Key Java concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and exception handling are utilized to manage and store data efficiently.

While this system is not GUI-based, it lays the groundwork for further development into a graphical or web-based application. It is a practical tool for managing basic hospital operations, offering room for expansion to include features like medical records, billing, and multi-doctor appointments in future versions.

This project is perfect for developers seeking to understand core Java principles while building a real-world application.
